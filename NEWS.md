## Major Changes
* Created a set of functions that facilitate 1) generation, 2) validation and 3) mapping of strictly formatted platemaps (#8) which describes neutralisation files in one folder (and all its subfolders).
* The platemaps can be used to get normalised values that can be grouped together.
* Vignette `How_to_integrate_a_platemap.Rmd` is created to walk through the above process.
* Using more formal documentation style using usethis, pkgdown
